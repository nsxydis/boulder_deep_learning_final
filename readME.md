# Instructions to use
1. Clone the repository
2. <Optional> Create a virtual environment
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. You should now be able to run the notebooks or launch the streamlit app.
5. To run the app, on the command line, navigate to the repository and enter:
_streamlit run app.py_

# Notes
1. Running this notebook will install some data necessary to use the nltk library. If you don't want data downloaded on your device, do not run the streamlit application.
2. Only the best model weights were included due to upload size limitations. If you would like to generate your own weights using the notebook, feel free to do so (it will take some time). I would strongly recommend running the code on a device with a CUDA capable GPU if you're doing this.
