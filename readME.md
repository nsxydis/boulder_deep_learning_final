# Instructions to use
1. Clone the repository
2. <Optional> Create a virtual environment
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. You should now be able to run the notebooks or launch the streamlit app.

# Notes
1. Only the best model weights were included due to upload size limitations. If you would like to generate your own weights using the notebook, feel free to do so (it will take some time). I would strongly recommend running the code on a device with a CUDA capable GPU if you're doing this.
